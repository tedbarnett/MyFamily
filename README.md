# Judy's Family Memory Aid App

A mobile-friendly web application designed to help seniors identify and remember family members, friends, and caregivers through photos and simple navigation.

## About This App

This app was created specifically for Judy, an 89-year-old user who wants an easy way to look up and remember the people in her life. The design prioritizes:

- **Extra-large text** that's easy to read
- **Big touch buttons** that are easy to tap
- **High contrast colors** for visibility
- **Simple navigation** with one action per screen
- **Photos with names** for easy recognition

## How to Use the App

### Home Screen

When you open the app, you'll see a search bar and category buttons:

- **Search**: Type any name, relationship, or location to find someone
- **Categories**: Tap a category (like "Children" or "Grandchildren") to see everyone in that group

### Viewing a Category

After tapping a category, you'll see photo cards for each person. Each card shows:
- Their photo (or initials if no photo)

- Their relationship to you

Tap any card to see more details about that person.

- Large photo with their name and role
